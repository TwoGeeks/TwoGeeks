**twoGeeks is a mobile application to allow students to find study partners to make more friends, knowledge and experiences as well as to provide an avenue for them to ask for help in subjects they are weak at.**

## Motivation

In Singapore, many students do not have a partner to study with especially if they are freshmen.
There are a lot of proven benefits of studying with someone especially if you need help clarifying concepts and doing homework.
Students may also want to expand their social circle and to make more friends who study the same subjects or modules as them.
Furthermore, we are also committed to help students with their schoolwork without having to spend an absurd amount of money on tuition.
We want to help students seek the help they need from other students who are better in concepts.
As such, we are motivated to create a mobile app that connects students, forge new relationships and make studying much easier.

## User Stories

As a student,
1. I want to create a profile about myself so that others can find me easily and match with me.
2. I want to look at profiles of other students, swipe left to view a new student and swipe right to send a friend request to the student so that I can connect with them.
3. I want to be able to filter students by age, gender, education level so that I can view selections that best match my preferences.
4. I want to accept or reject friend requests sent by other students.
5. I want to be able to chat with my fellow students so that I can plan when to study together after accepting a friend request.
6. I want to be able to see all my chats with other students so that I can resume chatting with them.

## Design of system

Using Adobe XD, we have come up we a mockup of our mobile application.

For our database, we have come up with a initial schema.
